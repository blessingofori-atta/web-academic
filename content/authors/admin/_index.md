Hello there! I'm Blessing, a Biostatistician at SDBC, University of Utah, with a passion for medical research. I specialize in diving deep into healthcare data and translating it into actionable insights. I am dedicated to providing state-of-the-art statistical support to researchers, making sure that their projects are not just scientifically robust but also socially impactful.

I'm also a bit of a data detective. I love the challenge of finding the needles in the haystack, and I'm always looking for new ways to use data to make a difference.

Whether I'm working on a study design, or analyzing data from a large observational study to identify risk factors for disease or situations, I'm always driven by the same goal: to use data to improve the lives of others.

**If you're interested in learning more about my work, or if you have a data mystery that needs solving, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always happy to help.**
