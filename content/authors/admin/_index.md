I'm a Biostatistican at UofU who is passionate about medical research. I specialize in transplanting data into actionable insights. 

#I am a third-year PhD student in the [Statistics program](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I come from Mpraeso, a beautiful small town in the Okwahu plains in the eastern region of #Ghana. I obtained my MS degree in Statistics & Data Science at the University of Nevada, Reno. Before that, I received my BS in Actuarial Science from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.   

#I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Kerby Shedden](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/kshedden.html) on Generalized Expectile Estimating Equations (GEEE) applied to Longitudinal Genetics Data.

#When I have some time to spare, I enjoy listening to music, spending time with my friends and family and watching soccer (I'm a staunch fan of Manchester United).
