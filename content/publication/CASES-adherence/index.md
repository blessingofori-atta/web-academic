abstract: Adherence to cancer screening is important for cancer survivors because they are at high risk of subsequent cancer diagnoses or recurrence. We assessed adherence to breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-(CRC)-screening guidelines and evaluated demographic disparities among a population-based sample of survivors. A representative sample of Utah survivors diagnosed from 2012â€“2018 with any reportable invasive cancer was selected from central cancer registry records for a survey about survivorship needs. We estimated the proportion of eligible survivors adhering to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force screening guidelines and calculated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were age-adjusted and weighted to account for sample design and nonresponse. And 1421 survivors completed the survey (57.2% response rate). Screening adherence was 74.4% for breast, 69.4% for cervical, and 79.7% for CRC. Rural residents were more likely to adhere to breast cancer screening than urban residents (86.1% vs. 72.7%; adjusted RR = 1.19, CI = 1.05, 1.36). Higher educational attainment was associated with increased adherence to cervical and colorectal cancer screening. Younger age was associated with greater adherence to cervical cancer screening (p = 0.006) but lower adherence to CRC screening (p = 0.003). CRC screening adherence was lower among the uninsured and those without a primary care provider (45.6%) compared to those with a regular provider (83.0%; adjusted RR = 0.57, CI = 0.42, 0.79). Surveys based on samples from central cancer registries can provide population estimates to inform cancer control. Findings demonstrate work is needed to ensure all Utah cancer survivors obtain recommended cancer screenings. Efforts should focus particularly on increasing uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening and reducing demographic disparities in CRC screening.
