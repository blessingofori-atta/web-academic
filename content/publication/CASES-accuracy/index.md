abstract: Race and Hispanic ethnicity data can be challenging for central cancer registries to collect. We evaluated the accuracy of the race and Hispanic ethnicity variables collected by the Utah Cancer Registry compared to self-report. Participants were 3,162 cancer survivors who completed questionnaires administered in 2015–2022 by the Utah Cancer Registry. Each survey included separate questions collecting race and Hispanic ethnicity, respectively. Registry-collected race and Hispanic ethnicity were compared to self-reported values for the same individuals. We calculated sensitivity and specificity for each race category and Hispanic ethnicity separately. Survey participants included 323 (10.2%) survivors identifying as Hispanic, a lower proportion Hispanic than the 12.1% in the registry Hispanic variable (sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 96.5%). For race, 43 participants (1.4%) self-identified as American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), 32 (1.0%) as Asian, 23 (0.7%) as Black or African American, 16 (0.5%) Pacific Islander (PI), and 2994 (94.7%) as White. The registry race variable classified a smaller proportion of survivors as members of each of these race groups except White. Sensitivity for classification of race as AIAN was 9.3%, Asian 40.6%, Black 60.9%, PI 25.0%, and specificity for each of these groups was > 99%. Sensitivity and specificity for White were 98.8% and 47.4%. Cancer registry race and Hispanic ethnicity data often did not match the individual’s self-identification. Of particular concern is the high proportion of AIAN individuals whose race is misclassified. Continued attention should be directed to the accurate capture of race and ethnicity data by hospitals.
